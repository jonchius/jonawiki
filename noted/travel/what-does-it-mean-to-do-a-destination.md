# What does it mean to "do" a destination?

It sounds funny in English, almost to the point of an allusion to some kind of bizarre eroticism:&#x20;

> "I did France last year!"

or&#x20;

> "We will do Spain next year!" (ðŸ˜² )

(What are you doing to the place??)

People will say this almost with a straight face but it sounds kind of vulgar to people familiar with casual non-business English. So, in a casual setting, people would usually say this with the sense of _**having visited a place**_. It has become so commonplace to use this verbiage that it almost does not carry any "dirty connotations".

However, when someone says it like that, two things also come to mind:

* They have very little desire to spend more time at the place
* They don't have very much curiosity about the place (and would likely not visit again)&#x20;

It almost sounds like code for "I had a one-night stand with (place) last year" or, less vividly, "I got (place) done and over with last year" . Granted, most of my own time in many countries have barely spanned a few hours. Still, to avoid treating a place like a cheap passing fancy, I would simply say something like:

> "I visited France last year!"

or

> "I set foot in France last year!"

Those kinds of phrasings:

* don't promise that I saw the place thoroughly
* don't treat the place like a "checkbox to tick off"
* leave open a willingness to go back to place the again
