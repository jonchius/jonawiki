# On media

### Media

We can define **media** (or a **medium**, in the singular) as a means by which information transmits (i.e. communication). One famous cultural theorist once equated a medium to its content. In some cases, a medium can act as content, as in the case of vinyl records decorating a wall, no longer serving the purpose of storing audio data for the sake of playing it back. However, in most cases, a medium merely holds content (a "bound holding").

#### Media as a container of content

Yet, we can find some advocates of media who proclaim that a medium "leans left" or "leans right". (We can substitute "lean left" and "lean right" with any diametrically opposed terms.) Currently, as of writing, one may say that a data network "leans right" merely because most of its recent content "leans right". However, the medium in question does not necessarily _have to_ "lean right" if enough "content creators" decide to make it "lean left", the medium can once again "lean left". Still, calling a medium (when used as a container of content) something other than a container of content sounds fallacious at best. A medium primarily acts as a potentiality of any type of content. One should then see the medium as simply a container.

#### Media typologies

We could categorize or classify objects based on _mediums_ because a work can either fall under one medium or another:

* **performance** ("\[living] sculpture" + "its positions in time")
* **sculpture** ("three-dimensional conveyance of an idea")
* **moving image** ("image" + "its positions in time" + \[optional] sound)
* **image** ("two-dimensional conveyance of an idea")
* **text** ("one-dimensional conveyance of an idea")
* **sound** ("non-dimensional conveyance of an idea")

The highest resolution usually takes precedence when classifying a medium. A "performance" could contain lower-resolution objects such as images and text but the medium would still fall under the classification of a "performance". A meme containing both an image and text would land in the "image" pile.

If we think about life, it really does just constitute a performance: the world whole as just a stage, simply with three-dimensional objects having positions in time!

We could also sub-divide each into the following:

* **asynchronous** (where the sender and receiver can engage whenever each becomes willing)
  * used for any level of urgency
    * e.g. message boards, text messages, e-mails, letter mails
* **synchronous** (where the sender and receiver have to engage at the _same time_)
  * used only to escalate utmost urgent matters
    * e.g. in-person meetings, video-conferencing, telephone calls, smoke signals

#### Media literacy

With the above, we should realize that part and parcel of **media literacy** rests on having a "dimensional perception" for the mediums. We should become familiar with which dimension a medium falls under and act accordingly. If we "read the room", we would not pick the wrong medium to convey our ideas. Such etiquette has lacked in a realm plagued by media illiteracy!

We all have experienced variations of the following:

* A group video phone call (synchronous moving image)
  * ...where an e-mail (asynchronous text) would have sufficed
* A person-to-person meeting (synchronous performance)
  * ...that only needed a phone call (synchronous sound)
* A phone call (synchronous sound)
  * ...where a text message (asynchronous text) would have done the job

One must therefore have **dimensionality** and **synchronicity** hard-coded in their minds when deciding upon which medium to use. Otherwise, some parties will find it simply an irritation.

**Rules of thumb for usage of media**

* **low-dimensional** and **asynchronous** mediums for business
  * i.e. dissemination of instructions, procedures, announcements, hands-on explanations, "important" information
    * e.g. e-mails, static websites, e-books
* **high-dimensional** and **synchronous** mediums for pleasure
  * i.e. parties, celebrations, jokes, personal location updates, discoveries, recommendations, "nice to know but not essential" information
    * e.g. chats, informal video calls, virtual reality (?)

### Summary

* A **medium** (plural: **media**) as&#x20;
  * a means of communication
  * a container of content
* Media types ("**dimensions**") may include complex content, or simple sight and/or sound
* Media usage ("**synchronicity**") may include asynchronous or synchronous
* **Media literacy** involves knowing both the dimension and synchronicity
  * low-dimensional and asynchronous media wins for serious "matters"
  * high-dimensional and synchronous media wins for informal "stuff"
