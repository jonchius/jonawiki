### Namespace pollution

when imported code from an external source interferes with (i.e. _pollutes_) one's code (i.e. _namespace_) to the point of dysfunction, due to:

* an external source's variable name accidentally matching a target's variable name
* an external source's variable name might also sound similar to a target's variable name, which can cause confusion to developers
