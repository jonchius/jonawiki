  * "freedom" for peasants
  * semi-capitalist era which became quickly suppressed
  * remarkable progress with greater equalities
    * this slowly slipped into an oppressive regime

  * gulags (but rapid industrialization)
  * forced patriotism, personality cults and propaganda
* 1950 **end of Stalinism** and beginning of Khrushchev (**de-Stalinization**)

    * prison camps (_**gulag**_)
    * single-party state
    * collective farms (_**kolkhozy**_)
    * "psychiatric clinics" (_**psikhushki**_)&#x20;

    * increasing disillusionment of the people
* late 1980s **Gorbachev (pre-collapse)**
  * the young "reformer" who tried in vain to promote
    * restructuring (_**perestroika**_) of the economy
    * openness (_**glasnost)**_ with the outside world&#x20;
