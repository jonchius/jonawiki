# üõçÔ∏è Retail

### Category killers

Specialty stores that focus on one aspect of life and do it well, contrary to **department stores** that try to cater to all aspects of life

### Power centres

(Europe: **retail parks**)&#x20;

Commercial centres as plots of land with several buildings whose tenants are retail outlets (usually big box stores) whose strengths include:&#x20;

* fewer common areas (e.g. corridors) for the property managers to maintain
* more flexible opening and closing times for each individual store&#x20;

Yet they have the disadvantage of having:

* stores under multiple roofs (an inconvenience in places with hot summers and/or cold winters)
* stores further apart from each other (often raising accessibility issues)
* only big box stores ("kiosk" shops become impractical in places with harsh weather)

Twists to the power centre include:

* "vertical" variants in high-density downtown areas
* "main street" variants to allow smaller stores
