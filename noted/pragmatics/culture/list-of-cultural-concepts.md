# üñºÔ∏è Culture

### Invented tradition

When a cultural item sounds fairly "ancient" but originated relatively recently (e.g. Scottish tartan \[19th century], "Chinese" chop suey \[post-WWII], Korean taekwondo \[post-1945!]) possibly due to:&#x20;

* clever marketing
* limited lifespan of a person

### Pizza effect

When a cultural item originates from somewhere goes to another part of the world and "spins off", the _spin-off version_ becomes identified as the "real thing" (e.g. pizza, "Chinese food", sushi, "French fries")

### Ship of Theseus&#x20;

When a system (e.g. a ship) has components that become gradually replaced:&#x20;

* Does the ship still retain its identity or has it become a completely new ship?
* If it has become a new ship, then when did it cease to remain as the old ship?

### Sorites Paradox

When does one thing stop being something after a certain amount of incremental changes?&#x20;

* If a culture keeps borrowing from others, when does its authenticity end?&#x20;
* If a song gets remixed so heavily, does it become a new song altogether?
  * This "remix" by Sigur R√≥s is ultimately based on "Feliz Navidad":
