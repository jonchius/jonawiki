# ðŸ‘‘ "Tycka om" ("to like")

"**Tycka om**" literally means "to like" (or "to have a desire for"):

* However, a literal translation is "to think about"
  * One tends to think a lot about something/someone when liking that thing or person, i.e.
    * "I like her" ("I think about her")
    * "I like football" ("I think about football")

(Such idiomatic structures in various languages interest me a lot!)
