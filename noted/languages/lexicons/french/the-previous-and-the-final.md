# ⚜️ The "previous" and the "final"

In French, the adjective "**dernier**" (**dernière** for feminine nouns) expresses the concept of "last". However, its position before or after the adjective changes the meaning slightly:

* after the noun to express a _previous_ time period
  * la semaine **dernière** (literally: "the week last" = "the previous week")
* before the noun to express a _final_ occurrence
  * la **dernière** semaine (literally: "the last week" = "the final week")

In English, we would simply use the word "last" with ambiguity, or use a synonym (such as "previous" or "final") to clarify which sense of "last". However, any synonym often feels too formal.
