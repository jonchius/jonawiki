# 🀄 Ways of expressing negation in Chinese

Some ways to express negation in Chinese:

* 没 (méi) = used mainly before the modal verb 有 ("to have")
  * (not to be confused with 没 (mò) which means "drown")
* 不  (bu) = used before most verbs, as in:
  * 我不写中文 (I \[do not] write Chinese \[words])
  * 他不用拼音 (He \[does not] use Pinyin)&#x20;
* 否 (fǒu) = "not"
  * for Classical Chinese and certain set phrases, similar to "nay" in English
  * 不置可否 (not put yea nay = "to decline to comment")
* 免 (miǎn) = “non-”
  * 免费 (no cost = "free of charge")
* 無 \[traditional] / 无 \[simplified] (wu) = "not"
  * for literary language and certain set phrases
* 别 (bié) = "do not" (imperative), as in:
  * 别在餐厅看书! ("do not read \[books] in the restaurant!")
* 勿 (wù) = "do not" (imperative, formal)
  * used in signs in China, forbidding the reader to do something
  * rarely used in spoken Mandarin
