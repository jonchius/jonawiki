description: the "family" in Icelandic
---

# üßä "Multi-duty"

In Icelandic, "family" translates to fj√∂lskylda which, in turn, translates back to "multi-duty". The components are:

* fj√∂l = multi-
* skylda = duty

The "multi-duty" allusion possibly refers to the obligations that come with being in a family. This curious term for family replaced an older word **hyski** which, even more curiously, now means "low-life". (**Hyski** thus parallels with the English word "hussy" which once meant "housewife" but later meant "immoral woman"!)
