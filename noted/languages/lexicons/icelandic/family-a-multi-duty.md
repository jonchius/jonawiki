# üßä Family : a "multi-duty"

In Icelandic, "family" translates to **fj√∂lskylda** which, in turn, translates back to "_multi-duty_". The components are:

* fj√∂l = multi-
* skylda = duty

The "multi-duty" allusion possibly refers to the obligations that come with being in a family. This curious term for "family" replaced an older word: **hyski;** even more curiously, hyski now means "low-life". **Hyski** thus parallels with the English word "hussy" which once meant "housewife" but later meant "immoral woman"!)
