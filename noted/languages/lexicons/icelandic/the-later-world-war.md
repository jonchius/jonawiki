description: the "second world war" in Icelandic

# üßä "The later world war"

In Icelandic, "World War Two" simply translates to **s√≠√∞ari heimsstyrj√∂ldin** which, in turn, translates back to "the later world war".&#x20;

This implies that there will be only two (rather than more) world wars: the former and the latter! However, this nomenclature still leaves open to the possibility that more world wars could exist in the future.&#x20;
