# ðŸ¥¨ "To in-give"

German has a verb [**eingeben**](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/eingeben)**,** meaning "to input"**,** but it literally means "to in-give"!

(This is notably similar in formation to the Scots "[ingive](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ingive#Scots)")

When used in a sentence, the "ein-" prefix separates, e.g.:

"Ich geb das Wort ein!"&#x20;

which literally means: "I \[am] giving the word in!"

but really means: "I am putting the word in!", or more commonly, "I am typing the word in!"
