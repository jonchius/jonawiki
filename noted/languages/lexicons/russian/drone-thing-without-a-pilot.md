# ü™Ü Drone : "thing without a pilot"

In Russian, the word for **drone** (as in the unmanned device that flies and has the ability to take wonderful sky-high videos) is **–±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫** (bespilotnik):

* –±–µ—Å simply means "without"
* –ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç is a loan word meaning "pilot"
* –Ω–∏–∫ is a suffix that turns something into a tangible noun (such as a person or tool)

This word provides much more clarity than its English counterpart as it describes a drone's nature. It is actually short for **–±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ª–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞–ø–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç** (bespilonyy letatelnyy apparat) which means "pilot-less flying apparatus" or "unmanned aerial vehicle" (UAV)!

Of course, with pervasive global media, and due to its brevity, the word **–¥—Ä–æ–Ω** (dron) also exists!
