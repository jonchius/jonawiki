# ü™Ü Russian nouns

### Introduction

Most nouns in English follow this simple pattern:&#x20;

* **-** (singular), e.g. table&#x20;
* **-s** (plural), e.g. tables
* -**'s** (singular possessive), e.g. table's
* -**s'** (plural possessive), e.g. tables'

### Nouns change by gender

In Russian, the ending of the noun depends on the noun's gender and its case (i.e., its role in the sentence)

* each gender has a different set of noun suffixes&#x20;
* some nouns have complete irregularities that don't apply to the patterns of regular nouns, e.g.:
  * masculine nouns could have endings like feminine nouns
  * plural forms might not follow any regular pattern

Russian grammar only seems very difficult, or at least, very different, to the English speaker, in that its grammar uses _word endings_ rather than _separate words_ to convey the same idea

### Nouns change by case

Cases show a noun's role in the sentence:&#x20;

* **Nominative** - the "subject" (the main actor of the action)
  * —ç—Ç–∞ _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞**_ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è ("this _**book**_ \[is] interesting")
* **Accusative** - the "direct object" (recipient of an action)
  * —è —á–∏—Ç–∞—é —ç—Ç—É _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥—É**_ ("I \[am] read\[ing] _**this book"**_)
* **Genitive** - the "possessor"&#x20;
  * —Å–ª–æ–≤ _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏**_ ("words \[of] \[a] _**book**_")
* **Dative** - the "indirect bystander"
  * —è –¥–∞—é _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ**_ 5 –∑–≤–µ–∑–¥  ("I give \[_**to**_] \[the] _**book**_ 5 stars")
* **Instrumental** - the "tool" or "accompanied"
  * —è —É—á—É—Å—å —Å _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–æ–π**_ ("I study _**with**_ \[a] _**book**_")
* **Prepositional** - the "location" or "focus"
  * —ç—Ç–æ –≤ _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ**_ ("It \[is] _**in**_ \[the] _**book**_")
  * Some prepositions such as "–æ" (about) use the prepositional case as well, to signify a sense of focus or emphasis:&#x20;
    * "—ç—Ç–æ –æ _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–µ**_" ("It \[is] _**about**_ \[a] _**book**_")
    * "—ç—Ç–æ –ø–æ _**—É–ª–∏—Ü–µ**_" ("It \[is] _**along**_ \[a/the] _**street**_")

Note that the two nouns, _**–∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞**_ and _**—É–ª–∏—Ü–∞**_ in the example above are _feminine_ nouns. For this gender of nouns, both the dative and prepositional cases have the same ending; masculine and neuter nouns have different endings for each case as will see below!

### Charts summarizing noun changes (noun declensions)

We call these suffix changes in Russian nouns "declinations" or "declensions". Below are the endings for _most_ nouns:&#x20;

**Singular**

| case | masculine                                       | ‚Üí   | ‚Üí   | ‚Üí   | feminine | ‚Üí   | ‚Üí   | neuter | ‚Üí   |

\* - almost any consonant

We notice that the suffixes are all over the place. This is unfortunately the case (pardon the pun)! Some suffixes reappear in other genders and in other cases. It's a spaghetti dish of suffixes, yet somehow this language still functions.&#x20;

Yes, that chart above looks completely soul-crushing to memorize - so don't! Rather, try to listen to songs and videos - somehow word association and pattern matching will make it all click!

\* - becomes -–µ–π when it follows –∂, —á, —à or —â

### Motivation

More than 200 million people speak this language, all ranging from the very intelligent to the very ... not-so-intelligent. So, it has nothing to do with intelligence but just habit!&#x20;

I myself don't practice this language very much, so this still looks very difficult to me ;)

### Demotivation

Now that we've went over the _noun_ suffixes, there are also separate suffixes for _adjectives,_ which too decline based on the gender, case and number! Then, we'll get to the way things pluralize based on the number of certain items. You'll want to throw things across the room if you don't already speak this language.&#x20;
