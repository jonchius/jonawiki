# Long strings

We could make long strings by using triple quotation marks like this:

```python
long_string = """
Today we introduce you some text that is super long!
We know that you will not read all of this but it is here to show you 
that we can write as long as we want and feed it into a variable 
so that it does not look like crap!
"""
```
