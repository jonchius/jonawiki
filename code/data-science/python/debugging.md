# Debugging

### Common errors

* `SyntaxError` : using the language improperly
* `NameError` : unknown variable (a variable not yet assigned to a value)
* `TypeError`: using incompatible data (e.g. a float) with an existing variable (e.g. a string)

Other **logic errors** may not appear as messages, due to the error having nuances that only human knowledge detect (e.g. a wrong physics formula or the wrong population data of a country)
