# ⚛️ React

**React** began in the early-2010s as a _JavaScript library_ that can:

* organize reusable parts of a website into **components**
* handle user interaction
* manage changes in the data (known as **state**)

### Mission

When we use React, we usually:

* **gather JSON data** (via `fetch` or some files) into "comfy" variables, which we can then
  * **consume the data** into various React components
    * **visualize the data** using JSX (a syntax similar in appearance to HTML)
* **listen to user input** (clicks, changes, keystrokes, mouseovers, etc.)
  * with handle methods
* **manage changes in the data** via **state**
