# JavaScript (essential topics)

Starting out, JavaScript will seem like it has nothing to do with working on a website but let's look at it this way:

* [**data**](javascript-data-primitives.md) form the building blocks of a programming language
* [**operators**](javascript-operators.md) work on that data
* [**branches**](javascript-branches.md) decide what data to use
* [**loops**](javascript-loops.md) eliminate repetitive data tasks
* [**variables**](javascript-variables.md) (especially [**objects**](javascript-objects.md)) store data
* [**functions**](javascript-functions.md) organize all of the above into chunks for later re-use
  * ... and **calling** certain functions can lead to ... putting content on a website!

If it seems all so theoretical at the beginning, know that a reward lies at the end of it all!
