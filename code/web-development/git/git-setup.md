# Git setup

After installation, we may wish to customize your Git with the following:

### User setup

#### Username

When you make a commit, what would you want to show as your name?

* Open your **Terminal**
* Configure your GitHub account globally on your machine (remove `--global` if you wish to configure your account just for the current repository):

```
$ git config --global user.name "joncoded"
```

* Let's confirm we have set this up correctly:

```
$ git config --global user.name
> joncoded
```

#### E-mail

When you make a commit, what would you want to show as your e-mail address?

* Open Terminal
* As in the above with a username:

```
$ git config --global user.email "example@email.com"
```

* Confirm:

```
$ git config --global user.email
> example@email.com
```

### Repository (repo) setup

To create a **repository (repo)** for the current working folder:

```
$ git init
```

### Remote repository setup

To connect the (already-created) **remote** version of our local repo:

```
$ git remote add [remotename] [repoURL]
```

Replace:

* `[remotename]` with any name (most often, this is `origin`)
* `[repoURL]` with the GitHub repository URL in the form:
  * https://github.com/username/\[repo].git

#### Removing the remote repository

For whatever reason, we can also delete the remote with this command from the local working folder:

```
$ git remote rm [remotename]
```
