# ðŸš€ Deploying on Netlify

**Netlify**, like GitHub pages, is also free, provides a `yourname.netlify.app` subdomain (and also allows us to bring our own top-level domain!)&#x20;

### Installing Netlify on local

* Install Netlify on the same folder as your app's folder on Terminal

```
$ npm install netlify-cli
```

### "Building" the app before deployment

* If we have not created a "build" (the compiled version) for our app yet:

```
$ npm run build
```

### Deploying the app

* Then we deploy by simplying entering the command (notice the [npx](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50605219/difference-between-npx-and-npm))

```
$ npx netlify deploy
```

* This will open up Netlify on the browser asking for Authorization:
  * grant the access and close the browser tab
* Go back to the Terminal and answer Netlify's questions with the following:

```
? What would you like to do? + Create & configure a new site
? Team: (username)'s team
? Site name (optional): (App's name)
? Publish directory build
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that the directory specified is **build**
{% endhint %}

Check the app in the URL next to where it says "Website Draft URL"

* If all looks good then:

```
$ npx netlify deploy --prod
```

* Finally, the deployment will happen on a "Website URL"
* Check out that Website URL and see if it worked!

Furthermore, you could go to:

https://app.netlify.com/sites/{your app-url here}/overview

...to _**set up a custom domain**_ and _**secure your site with HTTPS!**_

To **re-deploy** an app, repeat these steps starting from the _second_ step of this article!

We can sum up the Netlify deploy process as the following:

* npm run build
* npx netlify deploy (follow the instructions when prompted)
* npx netlify deploy --prod
